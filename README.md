## Overview
**Song of Twelve Feathers** is an immersive roguelite adventure game set in a fantasy world filled with magic, mystery, and epic battles. The game revolves around the legend of the "Twelve Sacred Feathers," scattered across different lands. Whoever collects all twelve feathers will gain the power to control time and unlock the secrets of the world's creation and destruction.
